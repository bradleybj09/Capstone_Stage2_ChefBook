Welcome to my app!

There are three locations that you need to enter an API key:

In the classes FetchRandomRecipe, FetchRecipeDetail, and FetchRecipeGrid:

The first line in each doInBackground method has a String apiKey that is set to "Enter api key here". You'll need to do so.

The api is from the Spoonacular API here: https://market.mashape.com/spoonacular/recipe-food-nutrition/pricing

There is a free contract that allows 50 api calls per day.
